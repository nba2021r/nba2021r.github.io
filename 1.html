<body>Oneida Active Shooter. 02/05/2021 - 
ASHWAUBENON, Wis. (WLUK) -- UPDATE: In an updated press release on Sunday, the Brown County Sheriff's Office says they are still actively working to get eyewitness statements of the shooting at the Radisson Hotel Saturday night.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Lt Kevin Pawlak/ Brown Co. Sherrfif "The Duck Creek Restaurant within the Radison that there was someone shot at the Radison and that's how the first calls came out," said Lt. Kevin Pawlak with the Brown Co. Sheriff's Department during Sunday mornings press conference.
Jawad Yatim, a witness, said he saw at least two people shot.
The Oneida tribe's reservation lies on the west side of the Green Bay area.
Anyone with a vehicle still at the Radisson on the second floor of the parking ramp can respond to the main entrance of the hotel and meet with security.
Webster said the casino is connected to a large hotel and conference center, the Radisson, also owned by the Oneida Nation.
Neither the gunman nor the shooting victims were immediately identified. Brown County Sheriff's Office said they are witholding names of the victims and the suspect until all next of kin can be notified. The office is planning a Monday morning press conference.
Brown County says it will not be releasing names of the suspect, victims, or officers involved.
"Our hearts, thoughts, and support go out to the Oneida Nation, the Ashwaubenon and Green Bay communities, and all those affected by this tragedy."
"It was targeting a specific victim who was not there but he still decided to shoot some of the victims friends or co-workers it appears," said Pawlak.
Gambler Max Westphal said he was standing outside after being evacuated for what he thought was a minor issue.
Investigators believe the shooter had "ties to the Oneida Casino from an employment status." Sheriff's officials say the person the shooter targeted was not at the casino, but he then shot people believed to be friends or acquaintances of the intended target.
Brown County Sheriff's Lt. Kevin Pawlak said investigators believe the gunman was seeking a specific person he was angry at.

Pawlak said authorities called for a "tactical alert" after receiving the report of an active shooter. That "brings every agency from around the area to the casino, to the Radisson," he said of the large law enforcement presence.

"I know for sure two, because it happened right next to us, literally right next to us," Yatim said. "But he was shooting pretty aggressively in the building, so I wouldn't doubt him hitting other people."
